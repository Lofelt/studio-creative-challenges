# ðŸš€ Lofelt Studio Challenges 

With the release of Lofelt Studio we have begun setting some haptic design challenges for our community to learn more about their haptic design workflows, practices and pain points. We collect and share the results of these challenges here for our, and other, developers and haptic designers to learn from.

In each folder you will find
- the challenge itself
- all resulting submission projects 

There are no guarentees that these will build on your machine and are delivered as is.
