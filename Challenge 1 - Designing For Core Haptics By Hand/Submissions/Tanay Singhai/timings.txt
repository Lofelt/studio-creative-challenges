For a start, that actually felt really good. Timing felt accurate.
Now to add more details: variation & more curves 
(i.e. non-linear ramps where necessary)

Results:
new bow release feels slightly worse (less meaty)
new snow feels better

Iterated bow feels better! I stretched out the ramp down (longer than the audio) 
so it feels "meatier". Also increased the first transient event's intensity to make it 
act a bit like priming. Next, I will experiment with adding a little transient effect at the end
to make it seem like the bow has "clicked" back in position. Let's try it.

Oops.. I had forgotten to increase the time of the continuous event...
back to making this better before I add the click.

Ok feels good now! Now for the "click"

Click feels good! More I can add... more transient effects during the spikes
to make it feel "rougher". Hmm they feel too close together to make much of a difference.

Trying to make it feel rougher by adding more transient events is not working as intended.

Alright. At this point I am fairly happy with the design we have.
