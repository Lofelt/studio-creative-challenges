# Creating Haptics (AHAP) by Hand
## Challenge #1 | July 2020
## Author: Daniel

### Background
We want to explore how developers create haptics without Lofelt Studio to learn more about the benefits of Studio’s workflow.

### Challenge
Create an App with 2 buttons. Each button plays an audio file and the corresponding haptic (AHAP). You can use this Apple example as a starting point for the App.
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corehaptics/playing_a_custom_haptic_pattern_from_a_file

The AHAP file needs to be created without any additional haptic authoring tools like Composer. You can start from any AHAP (json) template that Apple provides, and add the necessary breakpoints by manually adding them to the AHAP file. Using Excel, Json editors or your own scripts to output an AHAP is perfectly fine.

Please record the process via screen capture. If you like, you can also add notes about things that were specifically hard or confusing.

#### Deliverables
- A small XCode project with 2 buttons that each play audio and haptics
- A screen capture of the process of creating the AHAP files
- A short summary (5-6 sentences) about the process and where you struggled or got stuck

#### Supporting Information / Notes
- We suggest to timebox each AHAP to max. 3 hours, so building the App based on the above sample code shouldn’t take up more than 1 day
- We might use part of the screen capture for educational purposes
- AHAP documentation:
